Estimate pdf allows small businesses to quickly generate a PDF with their product costs for many customers.

The current version of the projects works for a single organization, but it aims to allow any organization to register, create, edit and customize their estimates. Check the roadmap below.

# How to test

[This project is hosted](https://estimate-pdf.web.app/home) under Firebase's Spark plan, and any user who wants to test can access it using these custom credentials:

User: github-example@estimatepdf.com.br
Password: github


You may note that the generated estimates will be issued under a single organization, which is currently not customizable.
